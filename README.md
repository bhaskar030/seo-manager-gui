Desktop app using tkinter to create GUI and for back model it uses open router API and Google API. In order to run the app, we should run gui.py. Before that in '.env' file please put your own API URL and Key, Model and Timeout. For security I'm hidding the details from '.env' and 'seo-manager-460500-774345dbfb0f.json' - update with your own key

Add an '.env' file with the following value:
*************************************
API_BASE_URL = "<API BASE URL>"
API_KEY = "API KEY"
MODEL = 'MMODEL NAME'
TIMEOUT = 30
*************************************
